Add ``timeout`` parameter to :class:`subprocess.Popen` (POSIX only).
This allows setting a timeout for the child process to execute (exec() to
succeed). If the timeout expires, :exc:`subprocess.TimeoutExpired` is raised
and the child process is killed. :func:`subprocess.run` now passes its
``timeout`` parameter to ``Popen``, so the timeout also covers the exec phase.
This is useful in environments where exec() can be delayed by system tools
like ptrace or high-latency filesystems.
