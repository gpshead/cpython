# Welcome to the team!

You are helping a CPython core team member work on the implementation of the
Python language runtime and standard library itself.

Use tools like `gh` to get information about an issue or PR in the repo.
Including using the GraphQL API via `gh` when appropriate.

Source files in this repo can be very long.  Check their size or number of
lines with a tool before deciding strategically if you should read an entire
file.  Changes will be often focused on specific areas of files instead of
needing the entire thing in context.

# Expanding your knowledge

* ALWAYS load a `.claude/pr-{PR_NUMBER}.md` or `.claude/branch-{branch_name_without_slashes}.md` file when you are told a PR number or when the current git branch is not `main`.
* Keep such a file up to date as an engineering notebook of your learnings and project state as you work on a task to make it easier to pick up and resume work later.

## Optional developer guides

* If these exist: `../devguide/developer-workflow/` and `../devguide/documentation/` they contain further detailed documentation on how we like to work on code and docs in this codebase.

# Source code

* The runtime is implemented in C as are many of the core types and extension modules
* The Python standard library (stdlib) itself lives in the `Lib/` tree
* stdlib C extension modules live in the `Modules/` Tree
* builtins, objects, and the runtime itself live in `Objects/` and `Python/`
* NEVER edit files in a `**/clinic/**` subdirectory; those are generated by argument clinic
* Unittests for everything live in the `Lib/test/` tree. Ex:
   * `Lib/zipfile/` contains the code for the stdlib `zipfile` module
   * `Lib/test/test_zipfile**` are tests for `zipfile`
   * `Modules/_csv.c` contains the code for the stdlib `csv` module
   * `Lib/test/test_csv.py` are tests for `csv`
* C header files are in the `Include/` tree
* Documentation is written in .rst format in `Doc/`
* Build time tools such as Argument Clinic live under the `Tools/` tree.

## Coding style

* For C, follow https://peps.python.org/pep-0007/. For Python, follow PEP-8.
* Be consistent with existing nearby code style unless asked to do otherwise.
* NEVER leave trailing whitespace on any line.
* ALWAYS preserve the newline at the end of files.
* We do not autoformat code in this codebase. If the user asks you to run ruff format on a specific file, it can be found in `Doc/venv/bin/ruff`.
* NEVER add Python type annotations to Python code in the `Lib/` tree.

## Building

ONLY build outside of the main repo directory.

* Use sub-agents when running configure and make build steps
* let `SRC_DIR=$(pwd)` and `BUILD_DIR="$SRC_DIR"/../b/`
* Setup: `mkdir "$BUILD_DIR" && (cd "$BUILD_DIR" && "$SRC_DIR"/configure --with-pydebug)`
* `make -C "$BUILD_DIR" -j $(nproc)` will rebuild
* Let `BUILT_PY="$BUILD_DIR"/python`

## Running our built Python and tests

* ALWAYS use sub-agents when running tests
* NEVER use `pytest`. CPython tests are `unittest` based.
* `"$BUILT_PY"` will run the interpreter we've built
* Individual test files can be run directly using `"$BUILT_PY" Lib/test/test_csv.py`
* `"$BUILT_PY" -m test test_zipfile -j $(nproc)` will properly run all `Lib/test/test_zipfile` tests
* `"$BUILT_PY" -m test` supports a `--match TESTNAME_GLOB` flag to run specific tests, pass `--help` to learn its other capabilities.
* `make -C "$BUILD_DIR" clinic` will regenerate argument clinic generated code. Do this after you've edited a corresponding input .c file in a way that changes a C extension module function signature or docstring
* `make -C "$BUILD_DIR" test` will run the entire test suite. Do that sparingly. Focus on specific tests first and ask before running the entire test suite.
* Some tests are packages rather than a single .py file. These require `load_tests()` logic in their `test_package/__init__.py` file in order to work via `$BUILT_PY -m test` commands.

## Scratch space

* NEVER create throw away idea exploration files in the top directory of the repo. Use a `.claude/sandbox/` directory for those. They will never be committed

## Linting

* Use sub-agents when running these steps.
* `make -C "$BUILD_DIR" patchcheck` should be made to pass before committing.
* For documentation changes `make -C Doc check`

# Guiding Mantras

Use extended thinking when you feel unsure.  Ask questions when you are still not confident.
